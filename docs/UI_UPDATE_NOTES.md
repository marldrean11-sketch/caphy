# UI update notes (brand-refresh)

Marl's UI/UX pass on the web console - motion, responsive, interactive.
One section per change, newest last, so Kem can review or revert each
commit on its own. Screenshots are in `docs/screenshots/`.

How each change was tested: `python app.py`, signed in with the local test
account, checked in Chrome at the widths listed (390 / 768 are the phone
checks - no sideways scrolling allowed).

## 1. Overview camera tile fills its column (Oct 28)

- **What:** `.feedtile .feedwrap` gets `width:100%`.
- **Why:** `aspect-ratio:16/9` turns `max-height:440px` into a hidden
  max-width of ~782px. On screens 1920px and wider the feed stopped short
  and left an empty gap beside it. Now the tile fills the column; height
  still caps at 440px, so `object-fit:cover` crops the top/bottom of the
  frame a little instead.
- **Files:** `web/static/style.css`
- **Tested:** 390, 768, 1024, 1440 (no change - already filled), 1920 and
  2560 (fixed: 782px -> 1038px / 1465px). Only the "Camera off" state was
  checked; live video crop still to be eyeballed with a camera on.
- **Screenshots:** `docs/screenshots/01-tile-width-before.png`,
  `docs/screenshots/01-tile-width-after.png` (1920px)

## 2. statuslight.js cleanup (Oct 28)

- **What:** `var` -> `const`/`let`; `poll()` and `post()` from `.then`
  chains to `async/await`; `caphyResumeCam` is a named function. Still an
  IIFE, so only the `window.caphy*` functions are global.
- **Why:** match Kem's JS style. No behaviour change.
- **Files:** `web/static/statuslight.js`
- **Tested (browser, scripted):** level / armed / sidebar + header counts /
  Camera-off overlays match `/api/state`; one click arms; a 0.4 s press does
  not disarm; a 1.2 s hold does; `caphyResumeCam` posts then re-polls; with
  the server stopped the page stays put through 2 missed polls and goes gray
  ("Can't reach CAPHY") after the 3rd. No page errors.
- **Screenshot:** `docs/screenshots/02-statuslight-offline.png`

## 3. Motion preview approved (Oct 28)

- **What:** `docs/motion_preview.html`, a standalone page (open it in
  Chrome, no server) showing the Oct 30 motion ideas on a cut-down
  Overview: 1 action toasts with Undo, 2 new-alert toast, 3 status light
  (existing), 4 page transition, 5 count-up numbers, 6 loading skeletons.
- **Why:** agree the look and timings once before wiring anything into
  `web/static`. Marl approved all six as shown.
- **Files:** `docs/motion_preview.html` (reference only - not loaded by the app)
- **Tested:** 1440 / 768 / 390, every demo plus reduced motion, no page
  errors, no sideways scroll.

## Noticed, not changed

- When the server is down, the top banner says "You're offline - CAPHY is
  running in Local Mode", which reads like an internet problem rather than
  "server unreachable". Cause: `caphyCheckOnline()` in
  `web/templates/base.html` sets `online = false` when `/api/health` itself
  can't be reached, so "server down" and "no internet" show the same bar.
- In the offline state the Camera-off overlay disappears (offline state has
  no camera list), leaving a plain black box. Same as before the cleanup.
